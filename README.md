# Ply Free Dashboard

A free Angular admin dashboard template built with **Angular 22**, **Tailwind CSS 4**, and the [Ply](https://ply-ui.com) free tier.

Use it as a starter for SaaS-style apps, or as a live gallery to review free Ply components in a real shell.

---

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Framework | Angular 22 (standalone, zoneless-friendly patterns) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 4 |
| Components | Ply free tier via [`ply-ui-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ply-ui-cli) (source copied into the repo) |
| Icons | Ply sprite (`public/assets/icons.svg`) |

---

## Features

- **Auth flow** — login, register, forgot password (mocked `localStorage` auth)
- **App shell** — free `ply-app-shell` with a collapsible mini rail, grouped `ply-app-shell-nav-section` links, and a compact topbar
- **App pages** — dashboard metrics, users CRUD with dialogs, settings with in-page `ply-sidenav`
- **Component gallery** — scroll-nav demos for primitives, forms, feedback, overlays, navigation, data display, and all 19 free form blocks (including hover-card, menubar, currency-input, kbd, aspect-ratio, scroll-area, loading-overlay, and cookie-banner)
- **Pro upsell notes** — comments where Pro widgets/layouts would extend the free shell

## Quick start

**Requirements:** Node.js 22+ (24 recommended)

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

### Demo credentials

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Email | `demo@ply-ui.com` |
| Password | `password` |

(Any email/password works — auth is mocked.)

### Other scripts

```bash
npm run build           # production build → dist/base-ui-free-dashboard/browser
npm run watch           # rebuild on change
npm test                # unit tests
npm run deploy          # build + deploy to Cloudflare Pages (requires wrangler login)
```

---

## Deploy (Cloudflare Pages)

The demo is set up for [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) with SPA routing (`public/_redirects`).

### Option A — Connect the GitHub repo (recommended)

1. In [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) → **Workers & Pages** → **Create** → **Pages** → **Connect to Git**.
2. Select `ply-ui-ng/ply-free-dashboard`.
3. Build settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Framework preset | None |
| Build command | `npm run build` |
| Build output directory | `dist/base-ui-free-dashboard/browser` |
| Root directory | `/` (default) |
| Environment variable | `NODE_VERSION` = `22` |

4. Deploy. Cloudflare will rebuild on every push to `main`.
5. Optional: attach a custom domain under the project’s **Custom domains** tab.

After the first deploy you get a URL like `https://demo.ply-ui.com`.

### Option B — GitHub Actions

A workflow is included at `.github/workflows/deploy-cloudflare.yml`.

1. Create a Cloudflare API token with **Account → Cloudflare Pages → Edit**.
2. In the GitHub repo → **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**, add:
   - `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
   - `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` (from the Workers & Pages overview sidebar)
3. Create the Pages project once (Option A, or `npx wrangler pages project create base-ui-free-dashboard-demo`).
4. Push to `main` (or run the workflow manually).

### Option C — Deploy from your machine

```bash
npx wrangler login
npm run deploy
```

Config lives in `wrangler.toml` (`pages_build_output_dir` points at the Angular browser output).

## App routes

## Component gallery

Browse under **Component gallery** in the sidebar (requires sign-in).

| Route | Covers |
| --- | --- |

## Project structure

```
src/app/
  components/          # Ply components (CLI) + layout-app-shell
  core/auth/           # Mock auth service + guards
  layouts/
    app-shell/         # Authenticated chrome
    auth-layout/       # Login / register / forgot
  pages/
    dashboard|users|settings/
    login|register|forgot-password/
    ui/                # Component gallery
public/assets/         # Icon sprite, static assets
docs/                  # Extra architecture notes
ply-ui.json            # CLI config (legacy base-ui.json still resolves)
ply-ui-lock.json       # Installed component lockfile
```

Import Ply symbols with the path alias:

```ts
import { BaseButtonDirective, CardComponent } from 'Base';
```

Alias mapping: `"Base"` → `src/app/components/index.ts` (see `tsconfig.json`).

> **Note:** Components that are themselves exported from the `Base` barrel (especially form blocks) should import their dependencies with **relative paths**, not `from 'Base'`, to avoid circular dependency errors (`NG0919`).

## Shells vs sidenav

| Need | Use | Tier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| App chrome (sidebar + topbar + content) | `ply-app-shell` (`layout-app-shell`) + `SidebarService` | Free |
| Grouped sidebar links (labels fade in the mini rail) | `ply-app-shell-nav-section` + `ply-app-shell-nav-item` | Free |
| In-page section nav (Settings, docs TOC) | `ply-sidenav` | Free |
| Unified product chrome (page + dashboard modes) | `ply-shell` | Pro |
| Nested / multi-level nav | `mega-menu`, `tree` | Pro |
| Full opinionated dashboard page | `layout-dashboard` | Pro |

Do **not** use `ply-sidenav` as the primary application shell — it is for section navigation inside a page body.

More detail: [docs/shells-vs-sidenav.md](docs/shells-vs-sidenav.md).

## Working with Ply

This project already has Ply initialized. Components live under `src/app/components/` (you own the source).

```bash
# List free + pro catalog
npx ply-ui-cli list

# Add a component
npx ply-ui-cli add dialog -y

# Update installed components from the registry
npx ply-ui-cli update -y

# Diff local vs upstream
npx ply-ui-cli diff
```

## Auth notes

- Auth is **mocked** — no backend.
- Session key: `localStorage` → `base-ui-dashboard-auth`
- `authGuard` protects `/app/*`; `guestGuard` keeps signed-in users off auth pages
